# --- Request Fields ---
# Mission mode selection

# Parameters for LAYER_SCAN
# Sea surface is Z=0. Depths are NEGATIVE. Altitudes are POSITIVE.
float32 scan_bottom_target_altitude_m # Target POSITIVE altitude above ground level (AGL) for the "bottom" part of scan (e.g., 1.5 meters)
float32 scan_surface_target_depth_m   # Target Z for "surface" part of scan (e.g., -1.0 for 1m depth, must be <= 0)
float32 scan_surface_wait_time_sec    # Time to wait at scan_surface_target_depth_m (seconds)
int32   scan_cycles                   # Number of up/down cycles (0 for indefinite, >0 for specific count)

# Parameters for TARGET_DEPTH_HOLD
# Sea surface is Z=0. Depths are NEGATIVE.
float32 hold_target_depth_m           # Target Z for holding (e.g., -50.0 for 50m depth, must be <= 0)
float32 hold_duration_sec             # Duration to hold at the target_hold_depth_m (seconds)
