# Parameters for LAYER_SCAN
float32 scan_bottom_target_altitude_m # Target altitude above ground level (AGL) for the "bottom" part of scan (e.g., 2.0 meters)
float32 scan_surface_target_depth_m   # Depth to consider "surface" (e.g., 0.5m, must be positive)

# Parameters for TARGET_DEPTH_HOLD
float32 hold_target_depth_m         # Target depth for holding (positive value)
float32 hold_duration_sec           # Duration to hold at the target depth (seconds)

# --- Response ---
bool success                        # True if the mission mode was accepted and started
string message                      # Status message (e.g., "Mission started", "Invalid mode")
